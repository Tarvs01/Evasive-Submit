This is a side project for a video I saw.

The goal is to implement a form that has a submit button that only becomes available when the user has entered all inputs correctly. If there is any empty or wrong input, the submit button will evade the users cursor in an attempt to prevent submission.
Once all inputs are entered correctly, the button positions itself well and stops evading at which point the form can be submitted
